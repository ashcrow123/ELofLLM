**TASK:**
You are a language learner. You are studying a special artificial language that has !<INPUT 0>! letters. You can see them in the 
**LETTERS** section.  Your task is to, upon 
receiving a **WORD** in the current artificial language, select the most likely **SEMANTIC FEATURES** that reflect the meaning of 
the **WORD**, based on **LEARNED VOCABULARY**.

**LETTERS:**
!<INPUT 1>!

**LEARNED VOCABULARY:**
!<INPUT 2>!

**WORD:**
!<INPUT 3>!

**SEMANTIC FEATURES**
!<INPUT 4>!

**REQUIREMENTS:**

1. **SEMANTIC FEATURES** will be presented in a JSON-formatted dictionary, where the keys are options (such as A, B, C, e.t.c), and the 
corresponding values are the semantic features. If you believe a certain semantic feature best reflects the meaning of the given 
word, return the key corresponding to that semantic feature.

2. Please output only a single string that contains the key of the selected semantic feature—do not include any additional characters 
or information.

3. The information in the **LEARNED VOCABULARY** may be crucial for your selecting. Please reference it carefully and thoughtfully.

4.Before you output your options, do a brief analysis of the current multiple-choice question to help you output more suitable options.

5.Output in json format, like **EXPECTED FORMAT**, please do not output any additional content.

6.For your convenience in observation and decision-making, all letters in words provided to you are separated by a "-".

**EXPECTED FORMAT:**
{
    "analysis": <do a brief analysis of the current multiple-choice question according to **LEARNED VOCABULARY**,**WORD**,**SEMANTIC FEATURES**>，
    "option": <Directly return options from "A","B","C","D","E">
