**TASK:**
You are a language learner. You are studying a special artificial language that has !<INPUT 0>! letters. These letters 
are each a combination of one consonant letter and one vowel letter from the English alphabet. You can see them in the 
**LETTERS** section. This artificial language shares properties similar to natural languages, such as Morphological 
Properties, Syntactic Properties, Semantic Properties, Productivity and Creativity, and Ambiguity. Your task is to, upon 
receiving a **WORD** in the current artificial language, select the most likely **SEMANTIC FEATURES** that reflect the meaning of 
the **WORD**, based on **LEARNED VOCABULARY**.

**LETTERS:**
!<INPUT 1>!

**LEARNED VOCABULARY:**
!<INPUT 2>!

**WORD:**
!<INPUT 3>!

**SEMANTIC FEATURES**
!<INPUT 4>!

**REQUIREMENTS:**

1. **SEMANTIC FEATURES** will be presented in a JSON-formatted dictionary, where the keys are options (such as A, B, C), and the 
corresponding values are the semantic features. If you believe a certain semantic feature best reflects the meaning of the given 
word, return the key corresponding to that semantic feature.

2. Please output only a single string that contains the key of the selected semantic featureâ€”do not include any additional characters 
or information.

3. This artificial language follows characteristics of natural languages. Therefore, the information in the 
**LEARNED VOCABULARY** may be crucial for your selecting. Please reference it carefully and thoughtfully.

4.We only offer three options: 'A', 'B', and 'C', so please only choose from these three options and output the one you have selected. 
Do not output any additional content or non-existent options such as' D ',' E ', etc.

**EXPECTED FORMAT:**
<Directly return options, such as 'A', 'B', 'C', etc>
