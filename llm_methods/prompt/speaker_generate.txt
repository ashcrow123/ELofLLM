**TASK:**
You are a language learner. You are studying a special artificial language that has !<INPUT 0>! letters. 
These letters are each a combination of one consonant letter and one vowel letter from the English alphabet. 
You can see them in the **LETTERS** section. This artificial language shares properties similar to natural 
languages, such as Morphological Properties, Syntactic Properties, Semantic Properties, Productivity and 
Creativity, and Ambiguity. Your task is to generate a word to express **OBJECT PROPERTIES**, which will be sent 
to your other language learner for he to guess the current **OBJECT PROPERTIES**. You will be given your own 
**LEARNED VOCABULARY**, which can help you generate correct words. In addition, this is a multi round communication 
process, and the **FAILED COMMUNICATION RECORDS** between you and your partner will be provided. 
The **FAILED COMMUNICATION RECORDS** is a dictionary in JSON format, with the key being a word you have used before and the 
value being your partner's incorrect understanding of the word.

**LETTERS:**
!<INPUT 1>!

**LEARNED VOCABULARY:**
!<INPUT 2>!

**OBJECT PROPERTIES:**
!<INPUT 3>!

**FAILED COMMUNICATION RECORDS**
!<INPUT 4>!

**REQUIREMENTS:**

1. You must generate exactly one word in this artificial language to describe the current object, using only 
the **LETTERS** listed.

2. You may reuse the same letter in the word, But the total number of letters used (including duplicates) must 
be between 2 and 6.

3. This artificial language follows characteristics of natural languages. Therefore, the information in the 
**LEARNED VOCABULARY** may be crucial to forming your new word. Please reference it carefully and thoughtfully.

4.If the **FAILED COMMUNICATION RECORDS** is empty, it means that you and your partner are communicating for the first time.

5.The **FAILED COMMUNICATION RECORDS** reflect your shortcomings in artificial language learning, which have caused
 you and your peers to be unable to align. Based on this information, carefully consider and regenerate a new word.

6.To ensure the standardization of the output, use the symbol '-' to space the letters in the word.
For example, <letter_1>-<letter-2>-<letter-3>-<letter-4>

7.Before you output the word, do a brief analysis of the words you want to output to help you output more suitable word.

8.Output in json format, like **EXPECTED FORMAT**.

**EXPECTED FORMAT:**
{
    "analysis": <do a brief analysis of the words you want to output according to **LEARNED VOCABULARY**,**OBJECT PROPERTIES** and **FAILED COMMUNICATION RECORDS**>,
    "word": <Output only the final word, without any additional information or characters,ensuring that letters are separated by a '-'>
