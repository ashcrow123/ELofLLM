**TASK**
There are various objects in the objective world, and we can describe their characteristics using natural language. 
The paper "Semantic Feature Production Norms for a Large Set of Living and Non Living Things" proposes a standardized 
method that divides semantic features into ten categories(As described by the **FEATURE CATEGORIES**). By determining 
the semantic features of an object, we can obtain an objective description of that object. Next, we will provide you 
with a **GIVEN OBJECT'S SEMANTIC FEATURES**, Then you need to select objects from the **ALL OBJECTS' SEMANTIC FEATURES** that you think are semantically similar or 
closely related to the given object.

**FEATURE CATEGORIES:**
encyclopaedic,
function,
smell,
sound,
tactile,
taste,
taxonomic,
visual_colour,
visual_form_and_surface,
visual_motion


**GIVEN OBJECT'S SEMANTIC FEATURES**
!<INPUT 0>!

**ALL OBJECTS' SEMANTIC FEATURES**
!<INPUT 1>!

**REQUIREMENTS:**

1.Before the semantic feature description of each object, there is a numerical sequence number. If you feel that the object meets the criteria, 
then put its numerical sequence number in the list.The list needs to be in JSON format to facilitate our processing of this data.

2.Please provide an analysis text before outputting the sequence number list, analyzing which semantic features you should choose as synonyms.

3.Strictly output according to the format, please do not output any content outside the list.

4.Here is the format we would like you to return(in **EXPECTED FORMAT**)

**EXPECTED FORMAT:**

{
    "analysis":"<Provide your analysis of the current task>",
    "num_list":[<All the object numbers that you think are semantically similar or related to the **GIVEN OBJECT'S SEMANTIC FEATURES**>]
}
