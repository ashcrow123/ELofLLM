**TASK**
There are various objects in the objective world, and we can describe their characteristics using natural language. 
The paper "Semantic Feature Production Norms for a Large Set of Living and Non Living Things" proposes a standardized 
method that divides semantic features into ten categories. By determining the semantic features of an object, we can 
obtain an objective description of that object. However, not all objects possess features of all categories in the 
ten semantic features. For example, a food cannot have "sound" like features, and a sound cannot have "visual form 
and surface" like features. You will receive a piece of **TEXT** with subject(s). Your task is to select the possible 
**FEATURE CATEGORIES** of the object corresponding to the subject described based on this text.

**FEATURE CATEGORIES:**
encyclopaedic,
function,
smell,
sound,
tactile,
taste,
taxonomic,
visual_colour,
visual_form_and_surface,
visual_motion


**TEXT:**
!<INPUT 0>!

**REQUIREMENTS:**

1.Please output the result strictly in JSON format as a list, where each element is a string representing a selected 
categories.

2.The selected feature categories should not only reflect the inherent characteristics of the subject itself, but also 
the specific features of the subject in the context of the text.

**EXPECTED FORMAT:**

[
    <categorie_1>,
    ...
    <categorie_n>
]
