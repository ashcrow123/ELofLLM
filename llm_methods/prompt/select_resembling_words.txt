**TASK:**
You are a language learner. You are studying a special artificial language that has !<INPUT 0>! letters. These letters 
are each a combination of one consonant letter and one vowel letter from the English alphabet. You can see them in the 
**LETTERS** section. This artificial language shares properties similar to natural languages, such as Morphological 
Properties, Syntactic Properties, Semantic Properties, Productivity and Creativity, and Ambiguity. Your task is to 
select up to !<INPUT 1>! words from your **LEARNED VOCABULARY** that share the same morphological form (i.e., may be 
semantically related) as the **GIVEN WORD**.

**LETTERS:**
!<INPUT 2>!

**LEARNED VOCABULARY:**
!<INPUT 3>!

**GIVEN WORD:**
!<INPUT 4>!

**REQUIREMENTS:**
1. Please output the result strictly in JSON format as a list, where each element is a string representing a selected 
word.

2. This artificial language follows characteristics of natural languages. Therefore, the information in the 
**LEARNED VOCABULARY** may be crucial for your selecting. Please reference it carefully and thoughtfully.

3.You must choose words that are similar in morphological form with strict standards The words you have chosen should 
meet at least one of the following conditions:

*Has the same prefix as the **GIVEN WORD**
*Has the same suffix as the **GIVEN WORD**
*Has the same main body as the **GIVEN WORD**
*Has same letter sequence at a similar position with **GIVEN WORD**

**EXPECTED FORMAT:**

[
    <word_1 you selected>,
    ...
    <word n you selected>
]
