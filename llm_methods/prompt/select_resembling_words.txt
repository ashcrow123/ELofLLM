**TASK:**
You are a language learner. You are studying a special artificial language that has !<INPUT 0>! letters. These letters 
are each a combination of one consonant letter and one vowel letter from the English alphabet. You can see them in the 
**LETTERS** section. This artificial language shares properties similar to natural languages, such as Morphological 
Properties, Syntactic Properties, Semantic Properties, Productivity and Creativity, and Ambiguity. Your task is to 
select up to !<INPUT 1>! words from your **LEARNED VOCABULARY** that share the same morphological form (i.e., may be 
semantically related) as the **GIVEN WORD**.

**LETTERS:**
!<INPUT 2>!

**LEARNED VOCABULARY:**
!<INPUT 3>!

**GIVEN WORD:**
!<INPUT 4>!

**REQUIREMENTS:**

1. You may select up to ten words. If your learned vocabulary contains fewer than !<INPUT 1>! words, or if you believe 
there are fewer than ten relevant words in it, just select all the words you consider to meet the criteria. There is no 
need to force a total of !<INPUT 1>! words.

2. Please output the result strictly in JSON format as a list, where each element is a string representing a selected 
word.

3. This artificial language follows characteristics of natural languages. Therefore, the information in the 
**LEARNED VOCABULARY** may be crucial for your selecting. Please reference it carefully and thoughtfully.

**EXPECTED FORMAT:**

[
    <word_1 you selected>,
    ...
    <word n you selected>
]
